"""Per-fragment snapshot test (PR 3.3).

Confirms that the two simplest spine sentinels — `gp_Pnt` (simple class)
and `Standard_Failure` (std-using class) — are byte-identical to their
frozen baselines. Reuses the byte-parity helpers from
`tests/sentinel/sentinels.py` so the asserter and baseline coordinates
stay in lock-step.

Cost: <1 s when `build/bindings/` is warm; skips with a clear pointer
when no fragments are present.

This is the cheap fast-cycle regression checkpoint for the whole
generate path. The full 10-spine sentinel suite remains in
`tests/sentinel/test_artifact_parity.py` and runs in CI exit
validation.
