"""Regression guard: PCH must never embed source-file mtimes.

This pins the fix for the recurring failure mode where clang embeds
`pch.h`'s mtime inside `pch.h.pch` and then refuses to use the PCH after any
cache layer (Nx, Docker image layer, named volumes, ccache) restores the
header with a fresh mtime. The symptom is thousands of false `fatal error:
file '<header>' has been modified since the precompiled header ... was
built: mtime changed` failures during `compile-bindings`.

The architectural fix lives in
`ocjs_bindgen.config.paths.buildPch` and is `-Xclang -fno-pch-timestamp`.
This test patches `subprocess.run` so it never invokes emcc, captures the
exact command list `buildPch` constructs, and asserts the flag pair is
present in order. Catches accidental removal in <1 ms with no toolchain.

See `paths.py:_assert_pch_survives_mtime_bump` for the runtime guard that
fires at PCH-build time when emcc is available.
