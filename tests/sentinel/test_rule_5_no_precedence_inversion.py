"""Rule 5 anti-precedence-inversion CI guard for ``libembind-overloading.patch``.

Policy rule 5 (``docs/policy/ocjs-trailing-default-emission-policy.md``,
also tracked as rule 6 in the policy doc's numbering scheme under
"Never invert the dispatcher's first-match-wins contract") forbids any
patch hunk that changes the precedence ordering inside libembind's
``$ensureOverloadTable`` or ``$getSignature`` beyond the four canonical
hunks Phase 0 landed.

This sentinel reads ``src/patches/libembind-overloading.patch`` and
asserts the patch text honours the anti-precedence-inversion contract.
It is the Phase 2 counterpart to
``tests/sentinel/test_libembind_patch_hygiene.py``: that sentinel
verifies the patch APPLIES cleanly + the post-patch JS contains the
expected hunks; this sentinel verifies the patch TEXT does not
introduce forbidden hunks 5 or 6.

The four canonical hunks (and their patch-text anchors):

1. ``$ensureOverloadTable`` arity-pad (Gate-1 hunk 1)
2. constructor dispatcher arity-pad (Gate-1 hunk 2)
3. ``$getSignature`` optional-wildcard short-circuit (Gate-1 hunk 3)
4. ``$getSignature`` Path B primitive-priority fallback (Gate-1 hunk 4)

The forbidden hunks:

* Hunk 5 — cross-arity type-aware fallback ("_exactSigOk", "type-aware
  scan", "cross-arity")
* Hunk 6 — concrete-beats-wildcard precedence inversion
  ("concrete-beats-wildcard", ranking comparators that demote
  ``optional === true`` matches)

The guard checks the patch text directly so a future PR adding a
forbidden hunk fails CI at PR-review time, not after the build that
produces the patched libembind.
