"""Sentinel: `bind-symbols` NX target runs **before** `link`.

V3 RE-SHIP wired `bind-symbols` as an explicit NX `dependsOn` for the
`link` target so the producer can never lag its consumer. This sentinel
guards against an accidental edit to ``project.json`` re-introducing
the bootstrap-ordering bug.

Two independent assertions:

1. **NX dep graph (project.json)** — `link` MUST depend transitively on
   `bind-symbols`. Without this, a fresh tree would invoke
   `verifyBindings` before any producer wrote the manifest, the
   consumer would hard-fail (post-V3) with a regenerate-pointer, and
   nothing would actually fix it.

2. **Shell entry parity (build-wasm.sh)** — the `link` and `full`
   sub-commands MUST invoke `step_bind_symbols` before `step_link`.
   Direct shell invocations (`./build-wasm.sh link <yaml>`) bypass NX,
   so the script mirrors the dep-graph contract for parity.

Pinning both surfaces means a future refactor that hoists either layer
trips the test in the same commit, preserving the contract as a
single-source-of-truth.
