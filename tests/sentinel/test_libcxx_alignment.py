"""Regression guard: libclang parse environment must use vendored LLVM 17 libc++.

libclang 18.1.1 must pair with libc++ 17 headers — emsdk's libc++ 23 pulls in
Clang 19+ builtins (`__builtin_ctzg`) that libclang 18 cannot resolve, silently
degrading NCollection template return types to `: int`.

Failure history:

- macOS baseline: libclang 18 + Apple libc++ ~17 = ~1-major skew, inside the
  libc++ "back to the latest released version of Clang" support window. The
  host build produced 596 NCollection declarations / 22 MB wasm.
- Pre-emsdk-routing Linux/Docker: libclang 18 + emsdk libcxx 23 = 5-major skew. Class
  bodies parsed, methods enumerated, but template instantiations transitively
  dependent on `__builtin_ctzg`/`__builtin_clzg` (Clang 19+ builtins libclang
  18 cannot resolve) silently degraded to `: int`. `_extract_template_args`
  returned `[]` for those return types. The container shipped a manifest with
  zero `NCollection_HArray1_*` entries.
- Emsdk-routing experiment (reverted): aligned host to container by routing every libclang
  invocation through emsdk's libcxx 23. Both pathways then shipped the
  smaller (broken) manifest. The fix was directionally correct (one stdlib
  for both OSes) but picked the wrong stdlib generation.
- Phase 7: vendor LLVM 17.0.6 (matching libclang 18.1.1 ± 1 major), prepend
  its libc++ 17 + clang 17 resource headers, pair with per-OS libc (Apple SDK
  on darwin via `xcrun`, `/usr/include` on Linux/Docker). Identical libc++
  parse semantics on every OS; libclang resolves every builtin its version
  knows about. Manifest regrows.

This test asserts the Phase 7 invariants directly against the real
`_get_parse_libcxx_include_paths` implementation. It is fast (no I/O beyond
`os.path.isdir` on `VENDORED_LLVM17_DIR`) and catches accidental
reintroductions of emsdk libcxx in the parse path, accidental host-system
C++ header lookup (the pre-emsdk-routing macOS bug), or accidental missing-libc
configurations (the partial-POC failure mode where libc++ 17 parses but
`uint8_t` is undefined).
