"""Sentinel — reachability invariants for the per-YAML NCollection link filter.

Asserts that `_filter_auto_symbols_by_scope` operating against the real
`build/ncollection-manifest.json` correctly drops NCollection entries
sourced from heavyweight OCCT subsystems (BRepGraph, XCAFDimTolObjects,
StepFEA, Plate…) when a typical small consumer YAML scope is in play, and
keeps the core gp/TopoDS containers a consumer actually needs.

Regression line for per-YAML overbinding prevention. Runs against the
manifest emitted by `nx run ocjs:generate` (no WASM link required), so
they're fast and pure-Python — suitable for CI.

If the manifest is missing (e.g. fresh checkout, never generated), every
test in this module is skipped rather than failing — `ocjs:generate` is
the precondition. Run it via `pnpm nx run ocjs:generate` if you see skips
locally and want the assertions executed.
