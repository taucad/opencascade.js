# OCJS Trailing-Default Emission Policy

Internal reference for how OCJS bindgen chooses an implementation primitive for each C++ source shape it encounters. Every emitter branch in `src/ocjs_bindgen/codegen/bindings.py`, `src/ocjs_bindgen/codegen/embind/constructor.py`, `src/ocjs_bindgen/codegen/embind/method.py`, and `src/ocjs_bindgen/codegen/dispatch.py` MUST cite a row of the decision matrix below.

## Rationale

The OCJS migration from arity-fan-out to `std::optional<T>`-wrapped bindings hit a steady stream of production regressions because `std::optional<T>` (genuine `Maybe<T>` semantics) and "C++ trailing default argument" (default-on-absence semantics) are different semantic primitives that were forced to share an implementation. Each new OCCT shape encountered (degenerate sibling constructors, multi-overload trailing defaults, cstring composition, null coercion, sub-2b shadowing) added a new `libembind` hunk, several of which invert embind's first-match-wins dispatch contract and are upstream-unmergeable. Two independent strategic reviews converged on the same destination: **no single primitive owns the whole problem**. This policy codifies the per-shape mapping so that the emitter consults a deterministic table rather than reaching for `std::optional<T>` by default. Full reasoning lives in the consumer-repo research docs cited in §References.

## Rules

### 1. Consult the matrix before emitting

Every overload/parameter-position emission decision MUST resolve to a row in §Decision Matrix. The emitter selects a primitive by classifying the C++ source shape (see §Classification Algorithm) and reading the row's "Best primitive" column.

**Why**: Ad-hoc primitive choice produces the dispatch-ambiguity, null-coercion, and sub-2b-shadowing failure modes documented in `docs/research/ocjs-optional-overload-poc-coverage-gaps.md`.

### 2. Detect sibling-overload aliasing before emitting `std::optional<T>`

Before emitting `std::optional<T>` at parameter position `k` of any overload of arity `N`, bindgen MUST scan every other overload of the same name (constructor, method, free function) in the same class/namespace. If ANY sibling overload of arity `N+1` exists whose first `k` parameter types match the current overload's parameters `[0..k)`, bindgen MUST emit `emscripten::val` discrimination instead (matrix row 8).

**Scope of "same class/namespace"**: the surface audit (see §References) confirms the production surface contains **zero** sub-2b instances that span inheritance, template-collapsed instantiations, or ADL-discovered free-function namespaces. All 19 production sub-2b instances are co-defined inside a single C++ source class. Therefore the detector's scope is bounded to a single class and MUST NOT expand to walk base classes, sibling template instantiations, or namespace-level free functions without a surface-audit checkpoint confirming the expansion is empirically required. ADL-spanning sub-2b is structurally impossible in the current emission because OCJS wraps every namespace-scoped free function inside a utility-class `class_function` registration (0 namespace-scoped `function("…", &…)` calls in 5,324 binding files).

**Why**: The optional-wildcard branch in `$getSignature` (`libembind-overloading.patch` Hunk 3) short-circuits to `true` whenever a field is registered as `optional`, which silently shadows the higher-arity concrete sibling. This is the BRepGProp_Face sub-2b regression class. Bindgen owns dispatch-ambiguity prevention; the dispatcher MUST NOT be patched to invert its precedence to compensate.

### 3. Compute JS-effective arity before checking dispatch collisions

Bindgen MUST compute the JS-callable arity of every overload AFTER (a) primitive-output stripping, (b) RBV elision, AND (c) default expansion (whether via optional or val) BEFORE checking for dispatch collisions. Two same-name overloads at the same JS-effective arity MUST go through val-discrimination or bindgen MUST raise `SkipException`.

**Why**: Raw C++ arity is not the dispatcher's input. Defaults and RBV stripping compose; most PoC corpora tested them separately. Collisions hide at the composed boundary (matrix row 27).

### 4. Tag absence semantics explicitly

Each defaulted parameter position MUST be tagged with one of:

| Tag | C++ source shape | JS-surface meaning of omission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default-on-absence` | `T x = D` (trailing default with concrete default expression) | "Caller did not specify; use the C++ declared default" |
| `maybe-T` | `std::optional<T>` (genuine source-level optional) | "Caller is explicitly conveying no-value" |
| `output` | `T&` non-const reference, output param | (omission not valid — output) |
| `polymorphic` | same-arity overload set, JS-distinguishable types | "Caller is providing this specific type variant" |

The tag determines the primitive (see matrix). `default-on-absence` is NOT the same as `maybe-T`; conflating them is the root cause of the NULL-COERCION failure mode (matrix rows 1, 2, 23).

**Why**: Today bindgen has implicit classification scattered across `_returnTypeRequiresValueWrapper`, `hasOutputParams`, `hasCStringArgs`, and `numOverloads`. The explicit tag eliminates ad-hoc gates and makes the decision auditable.

### 5. Strict-by-default null/undefined absence semantics

`undefined` argument → use the C++ default (or `std::nullopt` for genuine `Maybe<T>` parameters tagged `maybe-T` per rule 4). `null` argument → use the default ONLY when the C++ source admits null as a meaningful value (matrix row 30 — e.g. handle-optional reporters where a null `Handle<>` carries explicit "no progress reporter" semantics); otherwise REJECT with a structured `BindingError`. This rule applies to every defaulted parameter position regardless of primitive choice (`std::optional<T>`, `emscripten::val`, RBV envelope).

**Why**: `null` and `undefined` are not interchangeable in JavaScript. Treating them as identical creates two distinct silent-corruption modes:

- For APIs where null IS meaningful (matrix row 30 — handle-optional reporters, etc.), conflating `null → use default` silently masks the caller's explicit "no progress reporter" intent and the API behaves as if the caller had passed nothing.
- For APIs where null is NOT meaningful, conflating `null → use default` silently swallows a likely caller bug (a stale handle, a falsy guard) instead of surfacing it as a `BindingError`, materializing the default in place of the bad input.

Strict-by-default with explicit row-30 opt-in for the small surface where null IS meaningful preserves caller intent on both sides of the cleavage. The surface audit cited in §References found zero non-null handle defaults in OCCT V8 (matrix row 23 → speculative), so the row-30 opt-in surface is small in practice; the rule still pays its way as a defensive precondition for future OCCT additions.

### 6. Never invert the dispatcher's first-match-wins contract

Patches to `deps/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/src/lib/libembind.js` MUST NOT change the order of dispatch precedence in `$ensureOverloadTable` or `$getSignature` beyond the existing arity-pad and optional-wildcard hunks. A hunk that makes "concrete-arity-(N+1) beat wildcard-arity-N" is FORBIDDEN.

**Why**: Inverting first-match-wins is upstream-unacceptable (parent doc §S.5 rates this "very low" merge probability) and turns the fork commitment unbounded — every future sub-2b-class regression would demand another precedence-inversion hunk. The architecturally correct fix is bindgen-side overload-aliasing detection (rule 2).

### 7. Patch hygiene: reset libembind to pristine before patching

`build-wasm.sh:step_patch_embind` MUST copy `deps/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/src/lib/libembind.js` from a pristine vendored snapshot BEFORE applying `src/patches/libembind-overloading.patch`. Sequential patch application without reset accumulates duplicate `$getSignature` / `$ensureOverloadTable` definitions; only the last one takes effect, producing non-reproducible runtime behavior across machines and CI.

**Why**: The current build has accumulated five duplicate `$getSignature` definitions, only the last of which is live. Any measurement (Corpus B, Corpus C, smoke regression triage) without this precondition is evidence about local hot-edits, not the v2 patch.

### 8. Path B (cppTypeToJsType primitive-priority fallback) is a canonical hunk

`src/patches/libembind-overloading.patch` MUST include Path B as a fourth canonical hunk in `$getSignature`. Path B is the runtime mitigation for the `cppTypeToJsType` minifier-elimination issue and is required for `TCollection_ExtendedString(int)` vs `(double)` vs `(char)` overload resolution.

**Why**: Path B currently survives only as a manual hot-edit on the compiled artefact and is lost on every clean build. Landing it in the patch file makes it part of the v2 patch's stable surface area, not a local fix-up.

### 9. The hybrid IS the destination

The migration target is NOT "switch everything to `std::optional<T>`" nor "switch everything to `emscripten::val`". The target is per-shape primitive selection per the matrix. Rows {3, 4, 5, 21, 22} keep `std::optional<T>`; all other default-bearing rows use `emscripten::val` discrimination. This is the destination on architectural grounds (semantic fit per row); the per-row matrix-bench fixture has also confirmed empirically that the val-owned rows do not pay a runtime penalty for the choice (val measured 7–55 % FASTER than optional on the rows where both primitives are technically applicable — see `experiments/matrix-row-bench/results/bench-baseline-2026-05-28.md`).

**Why**: The eigenquestion is per-shape, not global. `std::optional<T>` matches genuine `Maybe<T>` source semantics (rows 21, 22) and trailing handle/value defaults that do not alias adjacent overloads (rows 3, 4, 5). Forcing it to also cover rows where ambiguity, null-coercion, or non-trivial defaults appear is the documented root cause of the regression trajectory. The fixture closes the historical Q3 "val might be too slow" concern — it is not.

### 10. Libembind changes must be suitable for upstream contribution

Any modification to `deps/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/src/lib/libembind.js` (via `src/patches/libembind-overloading.patch`) MUST be authored such that it could plausibly land upstream in emscripten. Patches that invert core dispatcher contracts (e.g. first-match-wins precedence — see rule 6) or that depend on OCJS-specific assumptions are FORBIDDEN. The OCJS fork commits to upstream-aligned hunks only; deviations require explicit reviewer override AND a tracked plan for upstream contribution recorded in `repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md`.

The four canonical hunks (arity-pad in `$ensureOverloadTable`; arity-pad in the constructor dispatcher; optional-wildcard short-circuit in `$getSignature`; Path B primitive-priority fallback in `$getSignature`) all satisfy this criterion: each is a self-contained behavioural extension that preserves first-match-wins ordering and can be motivated to an upstream reviewer without invoking OCJS-specific architecture. The forbidden hunks 5 (cross-arity type-aware fallback) and 6 (concrete-beats-wildcard precedence) fail this criterion and are excluded from the patch on those grounds.

**Why**: A fork that diverges from upstream becomes unmaintainable as emcc evolves. Every libembind hunk is a future-emcc-upgrade liability; the discipline of "authored for upstream merge" enforces architectural cleanliness even when contribution is deferred (per the production-stabilization gate tracked in `repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md`'s "Upstream Contributions" section). Rules 6 (no precedence inversion) and 8 (Path B is canonical) are the proximate constraints; this rule is the meta-constraint that disciplines all future hunk authoring.

## Classification Algorithm

Bindgen classifies each method/constructor by walking the following decision tree per overload group:

```text
For each (class, name) overload group:
  1. Compute JS-effective arity for each overload (rule 3).
  2. If any two overloads have identical JS-effective signature: apply dedup
     (matrix row 11) or raise SkipException.
  3. If >1 overload at same JS-effective arity with distinguishable JS types:
     emit val-discrimination (matrix rows 9, 12, 14).
  4. If trailing defaults present at any overload:
     a. Tag each defaulted position per rule 4.
     b. Run sibling-aliasing detector (rule 2). If aliasing found:
        emit val-discrimination at the larger arity that subsumes the smaller
        (matrix row 8).
     c. Otherwise classify per matrix row 1-5 / 23-24 / 33-34 / 36-37.
  5. If output params present: route to RBV (matrix rows 16-19, 25).
  6. If raw pointer or SFINAE/deleted: filter (matrix rows 15, 32).
  7. Otherwise: native embind overload by arity (matrix row 6).
```

## Decision Matrix

The matrix is the source of truth. Every emitter branch cites a row number.

| # | C++ source pattern | Example | Expected JS call | Best primitive | Justification | Risks / open questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Single overload, trailing scalar default | `SetUseSpan(bool=false)` | `obj.SetUseSpan()` / `obj.SetUseSpan(true)` | `emscripten::val` + `isUndefined()/isNull() ? D : arg.as<T>()` | Dispatch-ambiguity-free; future-proof against sibling addition | Optional is cheaper if no sibling exists today but class evolution may add one |
| 2 | Single overload, trailing value-class default constructed in-place | `Build(Message_ProgressRange = Message_ProgressRange())` | `fuse.Build()` / `fuse.Build(progress)` | `emscripten::val` + `isUndefined()/isNull() ? Message_ProgressRange() : arg.as<T>()` | Handles `null` naturally without a libembind contract change | Per-call cost measured: val 49 ns vs optional 74 ns (val −34%) per matrix-bench baseline 2026-05-28 |
| 3 | Single overload, trailing handle default `const Handle(T)& = Handle()` | `SetFuzzyValue(Handle(Foo) = Handle())` | `op.SetFuzzyValue()` / `op.SetFuzzyValue(handle)` | `std::optional<opencascade::handle<T>>` | Handle's null state is upstream-compatible with `nullopt`; R3 PoC validated all 4 call shapes | Non-null sentinel defaults (`= Handle_Foo_Default()`) MUST use val instead — see row 23 |
| 4 | Single overload, `const T& foo = T()` (const-ref to anonymous temporary) | OCCT-internal pattern | `obj.M()` / `obj.M(value)` | `std::optional<T>` | R5 shape 4 validated; `value_or` binds correctly to `const T&` | None known |
| 5 | Single overload, trailing default with scoped-constant or function-call expression `= NS::Const` / `= NS::Func()` | Scoped-constant defaults like `NCollection_IncAllocator::THE_DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE`, `BRepGraph_ParentExplorer::TraversalMode::Recursive`; function-call expressions like `Precision::Confusion()`, `gp::Origin()` are also valid here when surviving the `numOverloads == 1` gate | `obj.M()` / `obj.M(value)` | `std::optional<T>` | R5 shape 1 validated; bindgen pastes expression verbatim into `value_or((NS::Const))` / `value_or((NS::Func()))` | Eager evaluation of `NS::Func()` on every omitted call; val + lazy default may be cheaper if `NS::Func()` is non-trivial. Surface audit (see §References) found ~15 scoped-constant defaults in production and zero `Precision::Confusion()`-style function-call defaults (gate-excluded). |
| 6 | Multi-overload, unique arities, no defaults | `MakeWire.Add(Edge)` / `Add(Wire)` / `Add(e1, e2)` | `wire.Add(edge)` etc. | Native embind overload (arity-only) | Arity is the discriminator JS and embind preserve natively | Ensure no default expansion of another overload collides at the same JS arity |
| 7 | Multi-overload, overlapping arities with semantic conflict (sub-2a) | `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh{0, 3, 5}` arity-3 = (Shape, IMeshTools_Parameters, ...) vs arity-5 = (Shape, double, ...) | `new IM(shape, 0.1, true)` routes to arity-5 | `emscripten::val`-discriminated single ctor folding N and N+1 | Bindgen-side merge is upstream-safe and removes failure mode at source | Hunk 5 (cross-arity type-aware fallback) is the dispatcher-side alternative but commits to a custom-fork dispatcher |
| 8 | **Degenerate sibling constructors** `C(T1, T2 = D)` + `C(T2 = D)` (sub-2b — smoking gun) | `BRepGProp_Face(bool=false)` + `BRepGProp_Face(Face, bool=false)` | `new BRepGProp_Face(face)` MUST route to (Face, bool) ctor | `emscripten::val`-discriminated SINGLE ctor at the larger arity, dispatching on `arg0.isUndefined() / instanceof Face / typeOf === 'boolean'` | Hunk 6 (concrete-beats-wildcard precedence) is upstream-unacceptable and architecturally disqualifying; bindgen-side detection (rule 2) is the canonical fix | Detection rule: `min(arity_smaller) == k AND arity_larger.signature[k..] == arity_smaller.signature` |
| 9 | Same-name same-arity class-typed overloads | `XCAFDoc_ColorTool.SetColor(Label, …)` vs `SetColor(Shape, …)` | `tool.SetColor(label, color, type)` / `tool.SetColor(shape, color, type)` | `emscripten::val` + `instanceof` discrimination | Existing OCJS canonical (`_emitValDispatchMethod`) | Inheritance + handle-to-derived stability across emcc upgrades |
| 10 | Same-arity static + instance overloads of same name | `TCollection_AsciiString::IsEqual` (the only production instance per the surface audit cited in §References) | `oc.Class.IsEqual(...)` and `inst.IsEqual(...)` | Split val dispatchers — one `class_function` + one `function` | Embind cannot register a single name as both class_function and function | Defaults in only the static or only the instance subset must place val + default-discrimination correctly. Audit-confirmed surface is single-class; revisit if a future OCCT addition creates a second instance. |
| 11 | JS-indistinguishable integer twins (`size_t` vs `int`) | `NCollection_IndexedMap.FindKey(size_t)` vs `FindKey(int)` (V8 size_t migration shim) | `map.FindKey(1)` | **JS-effective signature dedup** — emit only the modern canonical (`size_t`) | JS has only `number`; both C++ overloads accept the same JS values; `int` variant is a source-level compatibility shim | Audit all NCollection V8 size_t migration twins via clang AST |
| 12 | Integer vs floating overloads | `TCollection_AsciiString(int)` vs `TCollection_AsciiString(double)` | `new TCollection_AsciiString(42)` → int; `(3.14)` → double | `emscripten::val` + `Number.isInteger(arg)` | Existing OCJS canonical; verified in `TCollection_ExtendedString.cpp:5531` | Range policy for values outside C++ int range (`>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), `NaN`, `Infinity` |
| 13 | `char` vs `const char*` overloads | `TCollection_AsciiString(char)` vs `(const char*)` | `new TCollection_AsciiString('a')` ambiguous | TS-only classification + explicit `_char` suffix escape; runtime collapses both to string and routes to `const char*` | JS cannot discriminate single-char from string at runtime | Decide if char overload should be exposed at all; many OCCT char overloads are not user-meaningful |
| 14 | Enum vs string overloads | enum registered with string-valued embind + string overload of same name | `foo(oc.Enum.X)` or `foo('something')` | `emscripten::val` dispatch + `Module.EnumType` membership check | Existing OCJS canonical (`string_enum` path) | Ensure enum string values cannot collide with arbitrary string overloads |
| 15 | Raw pointer params (with or without default) | OCCT low-level callback registration | Usually unbindable | Explicit policy: filter or `nullptr` sentinel | `std::optional<T*>` is rejected by embind's `wire.h:124` static_assert; `dispatch._convert_args` maps raw pointer to `nullptr` | Audit whether any raw pointer should surface as nullable `null` |
| 16 | Primitive output params (`double&` pure-out) | `Geom_Surface.Bounds(double&, double&, double&, double&)` | `const {U1, U2, V1, V2} = surface.Bounds()` | **RBV envelope** (`value_object` returned, no JS input slot) | `_emitOutputParamBinding` already handles this | OCCT direction tagging is incomplete; fallback heuristic "all primitive references = output" |
| 17 | Primitive in/out params | `gp_Trsf.Transforms(double& x, double& y, double& z)` | `const {x, y, z} = trsf.Transforms(1, 2, 3)` | **RBV input-passthrough** | Caller passes input; receives updated values in envelope | JSDoc must distinguish in/out from pure-out |
| 18 | Class `T&` output or in/out | `BRepGraph&` non-copyable class output ref | Pure-out: returned object; in/out: caller passes ref | **RBV** + `val::as<T&>()` reference passthrough | PoCs verified `val::as<T&>()` preserves identity, supports non-copyable | Copy/deleted-copy audit per class |
| 19 | `Handle<T>&` output param | `GeomLib.To3d(..., Handle<Geom_Curve>&)` | Caller gets returned handle field; no JS input | **RBV input elision** | Smart-pointer reassignment does not propagate through `val::as<SmartPtr<T>&>()` | Audit `Handle<T>&` that violates output-only OCCT convention |
| 20 | `const Handle<T>&` input param | Curve, surface, document refs as inputs | Pass existing handle | Native typed embind binding | Input, not optional | Should `null` be accepted for nullable handles? Per-class convention |
| 21 | Actual `std::optional<T>` return type | Future bindgen output for Maybe-shaped OCCT methods | `const maybe = obj.MaybeValue()` (`T | undefined`) | **`std::optional<T>` native** via `EmValOptionalType::fromWireType` | Real `Maybe<T>` semantics; T3 validated 2/2 | Smoke tests for return-optional dispose semantics if T is managed |
| 22 | Actual `std::optional<T>` parameter (genuine Maybe in source) | Hypothetical OCCT API authored with `std::optional<T>` directly | `foo(value)` or `foo(undefined)` explicitly | **`std::optional<T>` native** with explicit-undefined-policy | Source-level semantic; distinct from defaulted trailing arg | Catalog audit to find any real OCCT optional params (likely rare) |
| 23 | Defaulted handle param with NON-null default **(speculative — no production validation)** | Hypothetical `= Handle_Foo_Default()` (non-null sentinel) | `obj.M()` materializes default sentinel | `emscripten::val` + `isUndefined() ? <build sentinel> : arg.as<Handle<T>>()` | `std::optional<Handle<T>>` would silently use null instead of sentinel | Surface audit (see §References) found **zero** non-null handle defaults in OCCT V8 public headers; every handle default is `= Handle()` (null = row 3). Row 23 retained as a defensive shape; the silent-corruption mode remains a real risk if OCCT adopts non-null handle defaults in future versions. |
| 24 | Defaulted scalar policy flags (bool/enum/double) | `Build(Shape, bool=true, double=0.5)` | `b.Build(shape)` / `b.Build(shape, false, 0.1)` | `std::optional<T>` if rule 2 confirms no sibling aliasing; else val | Trivial case; sub-2b risk if any future sibling overload added | Class-evolution risk; rule 2 detector must run |
| 25 | RBV-non-copyable returns (deleted copy ctor) | `BRepGraph_Builder.Add` returns `BRepGraph&` | `using container = builder.Add(g, s)` (disposable) | **RBV ref-only envelope** with `[Symbol.dispose]` | `_isCopyConstructibleClass` returns false → fix in RBV non-copyable + integer-overload-dedup research | Independent of optional migration |
| 26 | Mixed-return overload groups | Same method name, void + non-void overloads | One JS method | `_emitValDispatchMethod` with `mixed_returns=true` returning `val::undefined()` for void branches | Existing dispatcher | TS overload declarations must mirror runtime |
| 27 | RBV-elided arity collisions | One overload has stripped `Handle<T>&` output → JS arity collides with another | Single call selects richer envelope | JS-effective dedup / RBV collision dispatch | Existing source ranks envelope richness | Rule 3 precondition mandatory; defaults composed with RBV elision are where collisions hide |
| 28 | NCollection template-instantiated containers | `NCollection_IndexedMap_TopoDS_Shape_TopTools_ShapeMapHasher` | Normal concrete class name | Source-level template discovery + downstream typed/val dispatch | Template instantiation decides what concrete classes exist | Audit defaulted template params and typedef aliases |
| 29 | ADL / free function / static helper | `BRepTools.Read`, `BRepLib.BuildCurve3d`, namespace-scoped free functions | `oc.BRepTools.Read(...)` | Explicit generated facades | JS has no ADL; emitter exposes resolved names intentionally | Naming and collision policy outside overload migration |
| 30 | Nullable object arguments (null is meaningful in C++) | OCCT APIs that accept `null` Handle as "no progress reporter" | `foo(null)` only when C++ accepts null | `emscripten::val` or native with explicit null policy | `null` is a VALUE, not omission | Catalog OCCT APIs where null handle is meaningful — must not silently mean "use default" |
| 31 | Explicit `undefined` argument | `foo(a, undefined)` — caller explicitly skips a position | Match omission only for trailing-default args; for genuine `optional<T>` params propagate as `nullopt` | Per absence-semantics tag (rule 4) — val or optional per row | JS callers and agents may pass `undefined` explicitly | Decide whether `null` is rejected where `undefined` omits |
| 32 | SFINAE-only / deleted-overload-only declarations | Template-only, `= delete`, rvalue refs | Not present (filtered) | Filter at source | `bindings.py` already filters rvalue refs and deleted constructors | Ensure optional wrapper does not resurrect filtered overloads via gate removal |
| 33 | Cstring-wrapper with trailing default | `IFSelect_Act.SetGroup(Standard_CString group, Standard_CString file = "")` | `IFSelect_Act.SetGroup('grp')` / `SetGroup('grp', 'file')` | `emscripten::val` + `isUndefined() ? "" : arg.as<std::string>().c_str()` inside the cstring-conversion lambda | Composes naturally with the existing cstring conversion lambda; no `value_or(...).c_str()` nesting, no null-coercion hunk needed | Per-call cost measured: val 181 ns vs optional 221 ns (val −18%) per matrix-bench baseline 2026-05-28 |
| 34 | Multi-overload, one overload has trailing default that overlaps another's arity | `MakeFilling.Add(Pnt)` / `Add(Face, GeomAbs)` / `Add(Edge, GeomAbs, bool=true)` | `filling.Add(edge, GeomAbs_C0)` routes to arity-3 Edge | `emscripten::val` discrimination at the trailing-default position INSIDE the existing same-name overload dispatcher | val and optional are functionally equivalent for this row; val avoids optional-wildcard short-circuit | Cleanest example of "choose val for consistency" |
| 35 | Same-arity sibling group where ≥2 siblings are all-optional (T1) | Synthetic: `(opt<double>, opt<bool>)` + `(opt<int>, opt<string>)` at arity 2 | "Last registered wins" — implementation-defined | **Bindgen emit-time rejection** (T1 guard) — `raise SkipException` | T1 PoC confirmed last-of-same-arity-registered wins | Surface in catalog audit if shape exists in current OCCT |
| 36 | Defaulted trailing param where C++ default expression is `T{}` | `Build(Shape, Foo = Foo{})` | `obj.Build(shape)` | `std::optional<T>` if rule 2 confirms non-aliasing; else val | Equivalent to rows 2/5 but bindgen extracts `T{}` literally | Same as row 2 |
| 37 | Reference-default `T& foo = singleton()` (default to long-lived ref) **(speculative — no production validation)** | Hypothetical — not observed in OCCT V8 | `obj.M()` returns reference to singleton | `emscripten::val` + `isUndefined() ? singleton() : arg.as<T>()`; do NOT wrap in optional | `std::optional<T&>` is forbidden by standard (R6-A static_assert); `std::optional<T>` would silently copy and lose reference identity | R6 guard already catches the bad case at bindgen time. Surface audit (see §References) found **zero** production instances; row retained as a defensive shape and to document the R6-A static_assert rationale. |
| 38 | Constructor or method parameter typed `std::initializer_list<T>` (NCollection auto-discovery bulk-init shape) | `NCollection_List_handle_BOPDS_PaveBlock(std::initializer_list<handle<BOPDS_PaveBlock>>, std::optional<allocator>)` and 60 other NCollection list/sequence bulk-init ctors emitted by the NCollection auto-discovery generator | `new oc.NCollection_List_handle_BOPDS_PaveBlock([h1, h2, h3])` | `emscripten::val` + JS-Array → element-wise `.as<T>()` iteration inside the lambda; lift into `const std::vector<T>&` or directly populate the container | Embind has no built-in conversion for `std::initializer_list<T>`. The current emission compiles (lambda is well-typed C++) but is unreachable from JS because the embind wire layer cannot lift a JS `Array` to a C++ `std::initializer_list<T>`. The constructor is registered-but-silently-broken. Val-iteration is the canonical JS-array adapter pattern in embind. | Per-element wire conversion cost; when `T = opencascade::handle<U>` each element needs handle-type validation; TS declaration must read `T[]` not `std::initializer_list<T>`; NCollection auto-discovery generator must learn to detect the shape and switch lambda emission. Surface audit (see §References) found 61 production instances; users currently work around via `.Append` and the silent breakage has not surfaced as a smoke-test failure. |

| JS-effective dedup | 11 | 1 |
| Explicit suffix escape | 13 | 1 |
| Filter at source | 15, 32 | 2 |
| Source-level template discovery | 28 | 1 |

`emscripten::val` is the largest single owner, with `std::optional<T>` second; together they cover the trailing-default surface, with RBV owning every output/in-out shape. Rows 23, 35, 37 carry zero production instances today; they remain in the matrix as defensive shapes (silent-corruption mode for non-null handle defaults, T1 all-optional sibling rejection, R6-A reference-default static_assert) — see the surface audit cited in §References for the empirical instance counts.

## Anti-Patterns

### Do not emit `std::optional<T>` "by default"

The migration's failure mode was treating `std::optional<T>` as the universal answer for trailing defaults. The matrix says it owns ~5 rows out of 37. Emit it ONLY when rule 1 + rule 2 + rule 4 confirm the row is in {3, 4, 5, 21, 22, 24 conditional, 36 conditional}.

### Do not patch the dispatcher to compensate for bindgen-emission ambiguity

Hunk 6 (concrete-beats-wildcard precedence) is FORBIDDEN. Hunk 5 (cross-arity type-aware fallback) is DISCOURAGED in favor of bindgen-side val merging (row 7). Every dispatcher precedence change is a custom-fork commitment that future emcc releases may regress. Bindgen owns dispatch-ambiguity prevention.

### Do not skip rule 7 (patch hygiene) before measurement

Any Corpus B / Corpus C / smoke regression measurement run against a libembind with accumulated duplicate definitions is non-reproducible. Reset to pristine first.

### Do not collapse `omitted` / `undefined` / `null` / `nullopt` into a single concept

These are four distinct semantics. The absence-semantics tag (rule 4) must be explicit per parameter position. Conflation is the NULL-COERCION failure mode (matrix rows 1, 2, 23).

### Do not treat `null` as a synonym for `undefined`

Strict-by-default per rule 5: `undefined` materializes the C++ default (or `std::nullopt` for genuine `Maybe<T>`); `null` rejects with `BindingError` UNLESS the parameter is tagged row-30 (null is a meaningful value in C++). This is a stricter constraint than rule 4's tagging — rule 4 says "tag the absence semantics", rule 5 says "treat the JS-side `null` literal as a non-equivalent input by default". Violations silently mask bad caller input on the row-30-disqualified majority surface and silently swallow caller intent on the row-30-qualified minority surface.

### Do not author libembind hunks that cannot plausibly land upstream

Rule 10: every modification to `libembind-overloading.patch` MUST be authored such that an upstream emscripten reviewer could plausibly accept it. Hunks that invert dispatch precedence (forbidden hunks 5/6) or that depend on OCJS-specific assumptions are FORBIDDEN even when no PR is currently planned. The discipline of "authored for upstream merge" enforces architectural cleanliness whether contribution lands now or after the production-stabilization gate (`repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md` "Upstream Contributions").

### Do not treat the hybrid as a fallback

The hybrid IS the destination (rule 9). Do not write or accept review comments framing it as "if Corpus C is worse, fall back to hybrid". Rows {3, 4, 5, 21, 22} keep `std::optional<T>` regardless of any bench outcome.

## Programmatic Enforcement

The following rules are mechanically checkable and SHOULD have bindgen emit-time assertions or CI guards:

| Rule | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Rule 2 (sibling-aliasing detection) | Bindgen emit-time check; raise `SkipException` with explicit error message and matrix-row citation when an optional emission would shadow a sibling |
| Rule 3 (JS-effective arity collision) | Bindgen emit-time assertion comparing JS-effective signatures across same-name overloads |
| Rule 4 (absence-semantics tagging) | Bindgen type system: every defaulted parameter position carries a tag field; emitter dispatches on the tag |
| Rule 5 (strict-by-default null/undefined) | Bindgen-emitted dispatch lambda: `undefined` → use C++ default / `nullopt`; `null` → use default ONLY when the parameter is tagged row-30 (null is meaningful), else throw `BindingError` with structured row-citation; smoke test per matrix row 30 instance |
| Rule 6 (no dispatcher precedence inversion) | CI guard: a smoke/lint check on `libembind-overloading.patch` that no hunk modifies precedence ordering in `$ensureOverloadTable` or `$getSignature` beyond the existing arity-pad and optional-wildcard hunks |
| Rule 7 (patch hygiene) | `build-wasm.sh:step_patch_embind` copies from pristine vendored snapshot before patching; CI verifies no duplicate top-level definitions in patched libembind.js |
| Rule 8 (Path B is canonical) | Smoke test asserts Path B behavior in `$getSignature` (TCollection_ExtendedString int/double/char dispatch) under a clean build |
| Rule 10 (libembind upstream suitability) | Reviewer-enforced; every PR touching `src/patches/libembind-overloading.patch` MUST cite the upstream-merge motivation in the PR description and link the tracked plan in `repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md`. CI sentinel `tests/sentinel/test_libembind_patch_hygiene.py` already enforces the absence of forbidden hunks 5/6 (precedence inversion), which is the structural backstop for this rule. |

## Migration Sequencing

The surface audit cited in §References produced the empirical inputs that anchor this sequencing: **38 matrix rows** (37 original + row 38 for `std::initializer_list<T>`); **19 sub-2b instances** across 14 distinct classes / 7 modules; **0 non-null handle defaults** in OCCT V8 public headers (row 23 → speculative); the canonical `std::optional<T>` domain `{3, 4, 5, 21, 22}` confirmed intact via 38 OCCT public headers using source-level `std::optional<T>` and confirmed production-emitted instances for rows 21 and 22.

The migration is a **big-bang regeneration** (no per-row / per-module incremental landing). The bindings live on an unreleased API, so generated binding files get regenerated wholesale per the user's no-backwards-compat / no-deprecation-phases preference; consumers (replicad, runtime, CLI) rebuild against the regenerated artefact in lockstep. There is no migration-period flag, no opt-in, and no shim.

The `null` vs `undefined` boundary is **strict-by-default per rule 5**: `undefined` materializes the C++ default (or `std::nullopt` for genuine `Maybe<T>`), `null` rejects with `BindingError` UNLESS the parameter is tagged row-30 (null is meaningful). This decision is part of the canonical migration target and ships in the same regeneration sweep, not as a follow-up.

**Upstream contribution of the libembind patch hunks is deferred** (see rule 10) until OCJS production-tests the patch surface through Phases 1–4 and replicad / consumer runs validate stability for ≥1 release cycle without dispatcher regressions. The deferred work is tracked at `repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md` under "Upstream Contributions". Every libembind change between now and then must still be authored to upstream-merge standard per rule 10.

1. **Phase 0 (COMPLETED):** Landed rule 7 (patch hygiene reset) and rule 8 (Path B canonical) — preconditions for reproducible measurement. Canonical 4-hunk `libembind-overloading.patch`, pristine vendored snapshot, dual SHA256 verification in `build-wasm.sh`, sentinel test `test_libembind_patch_hygiene.py`. Documented in `docs/research/ocjs-libembind-phase-0-hygiene.md`.
2. **Phase 1 (COMPLETED):** Landed rule 2 (sibling-aliasing detector) at `src/ocjs_bindgen/predicates/sibling_aliasing.py` with 14-case sentinel; landed rule 3 (JS-effective arity precondition) in `rbv.py` + `bindings.py` + `embind/method.py` with 12-case sentinel. Documented in `docs/research/ocjs-phase-1-rule-2-rule-3-implementation.md`.
3. **Phase 2 (COMPLETED):** Landed rule 4 (absence-semantics tagger) at `src/ocjs_bindgen/predicates/overload_classification.py`; landed rule 5 (strict-by-default null/undefined) via `src/ocjs_bindgen/codegen/val_default.py`; upgraded rule 3 to a hard skip; landed rule 5 CI guard (`test_rule_5_no_precedence_inversion.py`); landed NO9 sub-2b regression-pin generator (`scripts/generate-sub2b-regression-pins.py`, 15 generated `.mjs` pins). Row 33 val-discrimination wired; rows {1, 2, 7, 23, 30, 34, 37} deferred to Phase 3 to coordinate with bench fixture. Documented in `docs/research/ocjs-phase-2-val-dispatch-emission.md`.
4. **Phase 3 (COMPLETED):** Built per-row bench fixture at `experiments/matrix-row-bench/` covering all 38 matrix rows (including row 38 `std::initializer_list<T>`); ran live baseline with val + optional variants, batched nanobench timing. **Q3 closed: val empirically faster than optional on every measured row (7–55%, ±3 ns reproducible).** Bench baseline at `experiments/matrix-row-bench/results/bench-baseline-2026-05-28.md`. Phase 3A wired val-discrimination emission for the deferred rows {1, 2, 23, 30, 33, 34, 37} via `ocjs_bindgen.codegen.val_default.emit_method_with_val_default` driven by the classifier verdict (`overload_classification.classify_overload_group`). Phase 3B replaced the legacy `can_emit_optional` / `can_emit_val_default` gates with the single `_select_emission_strategy` router in `bindings.py:724` — the `numOverloads == 1` gate is gone (`sibling_count` on `OverloadDescriptor` carries the multi-overload signal), the `hasCStringArgs` gate is gone for val emission (row 33 composes the cstring conversion inline), and `hasOutputParams` / `returnIsCString` / `_returnTypeRequiresValueWrapper` survive as row disambiguators only. Phase 3C added sentinel coverage at `tests/sentinel/test_val_default_emission.py` (12 cases — rows 1, 2, 23, 30, 33, 34, 37 plus static / non-void / void variants) and `tests/sentinel/test_emission_strategy_router.py` (11 cases — primitive routing, return-side preservation, dropped-gate verification). Row 7 (sub-2a semantic conflict) is classifier-reachable via `GroupClassificationInputs.has_sibling_aliasing` but a production sub-2a detector remains future work — the surface audit's ≈50 instances need an independent enumeration pass before automated routing. Phase 3 completion is documented in `tau:docs/research/ocjs-phase-3-val-dispatch-completion.md`.
5. **Phase 4 (READY):** Big-bang full bindgen regeneration of the ~5,324-file binding surface; run all 79 smoke tests against the regenerated WASM; rebuild replicad against the new OCJS WASM and run its test suite (including the 3 identified bug-fix canaries — `BRepGProp_Face.normalAt`, `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh._mesh`, `makeNonPlanarFace`); apply the 28 documented replicad simplifications (consumer-side cleanup) per `docs/research/ocjs-replicad-post-migration-simplifications.md`. Phase 3 unblocks Phase 4 — the classifier-driven emission path is the canonical migration target.
6. **Long-term (P5):** Once Phase 4 has run for ≥1 release cycle without dispatcher regression, open the upstream-contribution PR for the canonical 4 hunks per rule 10 and `repos/opencascade.js/TODO.md` "Upstream Contributions" section.
