"""Shared symbol-resolution manifest registry.

Single source of truth for every post-link symbol-resolution mechanism.
Both the link-time `verifyBindings` path in `yaml_build.py` and the
post-link `validate-build.py` script import these loaders so they
classify a requested binding identically — no consumer re-parses C++,
re-runs set-difference math, or re-implements alias resolution.

Each resolution mechanism has exactly one producer (a pipeline stage that
owns the semantic knowledge) writing a JSON manifest in `build/`, and one
loader here reading it. The producer/consumer manifest contract lets
post-link auditors converge on the same partition the linker actually
acted on.

Loaders
-------
collect_compiled_symbols(build_dir) -> set[str]
    Symbols whose `.cpp.o` was produced by the compile stage. Walks
    `compiled-bindings/` (primary) and falls back to `bindings/`
    (legacy layout) so partial rebuilds against older trees still work.

load_ncollection_alias_index(build_dir) -> dict[str, str]
    Maps every NCollection typedef alias (e.g. `TColgp_Array1OfPnt`) to
    its canonical mangled spelling (`NCollection_Array1_gp_Pnt`). Reads
    `build/ncollection-manifest.json`'s `template_typedefs` field (schema
    v2, written by `discover.py::write_manifest`). Hard-fails on pre-v2
    manifests with a regenerate-pointer error — the v1 schema misread
    `source_classes[]` (a reachability tag) as an alias map, which is
    the bug V1 RE-SHIP eliminates.

builtin_binding_symbols(build_dir) -> frozenset[str]
    Embind registration names from the dedicated `bind-symbols` NX stage
    (`ocjs_bindgen.bind_symbols.main`) which parses
    BUILTIN_ADDITIONAL_BIND_CODE + consumer additionalBindCode via
    libclang and writes `build/additional-bind-symbols.json`. NX dep
    graph guarantees the manifest exists before any consumer that
    depends on `bind-symbols`; missing manifest = consumer was invoked
    out of order, which the loader surfaces as a hard-fail.

resolve_requested_symbols(requested, compiled, alias_index, builtins)
    Partition a requested binding set into four buckets:
      * `satisfied_by_compiled` — present in `compiled`
      * `alias_resolved`        — alias name with a compiled canonical
      * `builtin`               — registered in the bindings TU
      * `truly_missing`         — none of the above; genuine link gap

Degradation
-----------
Two failure modes are distinguished:

* **Manifest absent** (fresh checkout, never built) — loaders return an
  empty container; the resulting `truly_missing` bucket simply contains
  every requested symbol. Verifier callers detect the manifest path is
  missing and degrade gracefully.
* **Manifest present but pre-v2 / malformed** — loaders raise a
  `ManifestSchemaError` carrying a regenerate-pointer message. Silent
  degradation on a stale manifest would re-introduce the false-positive
  class the audit identified.
