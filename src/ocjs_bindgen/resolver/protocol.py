"""``ResolverContext`` Protocol — the surface every resolver strategy needs.

Phase 1 PR 1.5 of the OCJS Bindgen Modular Refactor extracted the
TypeScript type-resolver from the ``TypescriptBindings`` god-class into
:mod:`ocjs_bindgen.resolver`. The strategies are pure functions taking
``ctx: ResolverContext`` as their first argument so they can be unit-tested
against a mocked binder (Phase 3 PR 3.2). At runtime ``ctx`` is the live
``TypescriptBindings`` instance — Python's structural typing means the
``Protocol`` annotation is documentation rather than a runtime constraint,
so behaviour stays bit-for-bit identical to the legacy in-line code.

Cross-cutting state owned by the binder (``exports``, ``tuInfo``, the
``_known_export_names`` / ``_known_typedef_names`` / ``_namespace_scoped_interfaces``
class-level sets, ``_NUMERIC_TYPES`` / ``_STRING_TYPES`` / ``_BOOLEAN_TYPES``
constant maps, the canonical-fallback / builtin / nested-type resolvers,
and the diagnostics sink) is exposed by attribute / method access — the
Protocol enumerates the surface for future readers, but new strategies
should reach for binder state via the existing names rather than smuggling
new dependencies through.
