# Build System

The opencascade.js build system uses **Nx** for task orchestration and caching, replacing the custom `build-cache.py` system. The underlying Python build scripts (`Common.py`, `compileBindings.py`, `buildFromYaml.py`) remain, but are now invoked through Nx targets with correct input hashing and cache management.

## Architecture

The central design principle: **compile-time configuration and link-time flags are orthogonal concerns controlled by different actors**.

### Channel 1: Compile-time configuration (maintainer-controlled)

- Defined in `build-configs/configurations.json` as named configurations
- Selected via `--config <name>` CLI argument or `OCJS_CONFIG` env var
- Sets `OCJS_*` env vars for compile, wasm-opt, and closure compiler steps
- Individual env vars can override any config value

### Channel 2: Link-time flags (consumer-controlled)

- Defined in the consumer YAML's `emccFlags` array
- Passed **verbatim** to `emcc` at link time — no stripping, no filtering
- Exactly the same API consumers have used since v7.6.2

## Component Glossary

A reference map of every moving part in the bindgen pipeline. Grouped by role so the layering is visible: how source code flows from OCCT headers, through a parser, through a code generator, into a compiler, into a linker, and out as a WebAssembly module.

The whole pipeline can be read top-to-bottom as: **F generates C++ from E using B/C/G; D then compiles+links that C++ into H.**

### A. Toolchain meta-installers

These manage *other* toolchains. They are not compilers or libraries themselves.

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **emsdk** (Emscripten SDK) | A Python-based meta-installer that downloads and version-locks the entire Emscripten toolchain (clang, `emcc`, libc++, sysroot, node, etc.) as a single bundle. We pin a specific emsdk release in `DEPS.json`; running `scripts/clone-deps.sh` installs it under `deps/emsdk/`. The bundle's exact clang/libc++ commits come from emsdk's manifest, not from us. |
| **uv** (Astral) | Hermetic Python interpreter + venv manager. Reads `.python-version` and `requirements.txt` to install an exact CPython and an exact set of Python packages into `.venv/`. Has no role in C++ — it only sets up the Python that runs the bindgen scripts. |

### B. The C++ frontend (what reads source code)

Two distinct copies of clang are in play here. The distinction matters.

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **clang** (the driver, from emsdk) | The `clang++` executable at `deps/emsdk/upstream/bin/clang`. Drives preprocessing → parsing → codegen → linking. Wrapped by `emcc` to inject wasm-specific defaults. Version is whatever emsdk's manifest pinned (currently ahead of any released LLVM). |
| **libclang** (the Python binding) | The pip package `libclang` exposes ctypes bindings to a `libclang.{so,dylib}` — the C library form of the clang frontend. The bindgen's discover pass uses this to parse OCCT headers into an AST it can walk. **This is a separate clang from the driver above** and its version is independent. Pinned in `requirements.txt`. |
| **clang resource directory** | A small directory of compiler-builtin headers (`stddef.h`, `stdint.h`, `arm_neon.h`, intrinsic shims) that ships *with* every clang at `lib/clang/<N>/include/`. Defines macros and types that depend on the compiler's own version (`__INT32_C`, `__builtin_ctzg`, etc.) and **must match the clang version reading them**. |

> **Important pairing rule:** libclang and libc++ are released together from the LLVM monorepo and the LLVM project only supports pairings within ±1 major release (per the official libc++ compiler-support policy). The parse-side libclang version and the libc++ headers libclang reads must stay aligned. See "C. The C++ standard library" below.

### C. The C++ standard library

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **libc++** (a.k.a. **libcxx**) | LLVM's C++ standard library implementation — `std::vector`, `std::optional`, `<algorithm>`, etc. **At parse time only the headers matter**; the runtime is irrelevant to libclang. libc++ headers `#include` compiler intrinsics from the clang resource directory and assume a minimum clang version. The libc++ release that ships in `deps/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/system/lib/libcxx/include/` is whatever emsdk's vendored clang shipped with. |
| **libc++abi** | Companion runtime to libc++ providing exception types, RTTI helpers, demanglers. Statically linked into the wasm at compile/link time. Not consumed during parse. |

### D. The emscripten compile/link layer

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **emcc** | Emscripten's `clang++` wrapper at `deps/emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc`. Adds `-target wasm32-unknown-emscripten`, points clang at the emscripten sysroot, calls `wasm-ld` at link time, then runs `wasm-opt`. Build scripts invoke `emcc`, not `clang` directly. |
| **wasm-ld** (a.k.a. **lld**) | LLVM's WebAssembly linker. Takes `.o` files compiled by emcc and links them into a `.wasm` module. Performs dead-code elimination of unreferenced symbols — this is where the link-time NCollection filter operates. |
| **binaryen / wasm-opt** | Post-link wasm bytecode optimiser. Shrinks and optimises the linked module. Invoked by `emcc` at `-O2` and above. |
| **emscripten sysroot** | A faux POSIX environment for wasm builds (`inttypes.h`, `wchar.h`, pthread shims, OpenGL/EGL stubs, etc.) under `system/include/` and `cache/sysroot/include/`. Replaces the host OS's C library headers so wasm builds are OS-independent. |
| **embind** | C++ template library shipped inside emscripten that generates the JS↔C++ glue from `EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS(name) { class_<X>(…); }` macro blocks. **This is the actual binding mechanism** — the bindgen emits embind code; embind expands at compile time to produce the JS shims. |

### E. The OCCT source being wrapped

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **OCCT** (OpenCASCADE Technology) | The CAD kernel we produce bindings for. ~13,000 C++ headers organised into "packages" (TKMath, TKGeomBase, TKBRep, etc.). Cloned to `deps/OCCT/` at the commit pinned in `DEPS.json`. |
| **NCollection** | OCCT's home-grown template-based container library (`NCollection_Array1<T>`, `NCollection_HArray1<T>`, `NCollection_Sequence<T>`, `NCollection_DataMap<K,V>`, etc.). Used pervasively as parameter and return types. The bindgen enumerates the specific instantiations reachable from bound classes and produces concrete wrappers for each — without this enumeration step the generated `.d.ts` would lose its type fidelity. |
| **Standard / Standard_Macro / Standard_Integer** | OCCT's foundational type system. `Standard_Integer = int`, `Standard_Real = double`, `Standard_EXPORT` = compiler visibility attribute, `Handle(T) = opencascade::handle<T>`. Every OCCT header transitively includes this; its successful parse is a precondition for any class body downstream to parse. |
| **rapidjson** | Header-only JSON parser. OCCT uses it for glTF I/O. Pure headers, no compile required. Cloned to `deps/rapidjson/`. |
| **FreeType** | Font rendering library. OCCT depends on it for text annotations and 3D text features. Compiled to wasm and statically linked. Cloned to `deps/freetype/`. |

### F. The bindgen (`src/ocjs_bindgen/`)

Our code. Generates embind C++ from OCCT headers, then drives `emcc` to compile+link the result.

| component | role |
| --- | --- |
| **`config/paths.py`** | Resolves include paths for the libclang parse, including the libc++ headers libclang reads. Single source of truth for where headers come from. |
| **`config/flags.py`** | Build-flag state machine consumed by the compile/link drivers. Implements the env-var precedence rules documented under [Flag Precedence](#flag-precedence). |
| **`ast/parse.py`** | The single `libclang.Index.parse()` call site. Builds the giant `myMain.h` translation unit from all OCCT includes and hands it to libclang. |
| **`discover.py`** | The NCollection enumeration pass. Walks bound class methods, extracts template instantiations from their parameter and return types, mangles them into manifest entries (e.g. `NCollection_HArray1<gp_Pnt>` → `NCollection_HArray1_gp_Pnt`). Writes `build/ncollection-manifest.json`. |
| **`codegen/embind/`** | Generates the `EMSCRIPTEN_BINDINGS(name) { class_<X>("X").function("foo", &X::foo); }` C++ source files that `emcc` compiles. |
| **`link/rewrite.py`** | Applies the link-time NCollection filter — restricts the wasm-ld link set to symbols actually reachable from the consumer's bound classes. |
| **`filters/`** | Header-level and package-level exclusion rules (read from `bindgen-filters.yaml`). Drops OCCT packages that have no wasm meaning (OpenGL platform headers, OSD platform abstractions, etc.) before they reach the parse stage. |
| **`docs/`** | Doxygen-comment extractor; folds OCCT's `/** … */` blocks into JSDoc on the generated `.d.ts`. |
| **`build_drivers/`** | Subprocess wrappers around `emcc`, `wasm-ld`, `wasm-opt`, Closure Compiler, etc. The boundary between Python orchestration and shell processes. |

### G. Per-build artifacts (regenerated each run)

These are *not* source — they're intermediate files the pipeline produces and re-uses.

| artifact | role |
| --- | --- |
| **`build/occt-includes/`** (the **flat include directory**) | A symlink farm aliasing every OCCT header by its bare basename, so `#include "Poly_Triangulation.hxx"` resolves without enumerating every OCCT subdirectory on `-I`. Built by `buildFlatIncludes()` in `paths.py`. |
| **`build/pch.h`** + **`build/pch.h.pch`** (the **precompiled header**) | A single header that `#include`s every OCCT and embind header, then precompiled by emcc into a binary form. Every embind translation unit at compile time loads the PCH instead of re-parsing thousands of headers — gives a ~25× compilation speedup. Pure compile-side optimisation; does not affect the libclang discover pass. |
| **`build/ncollection-manifest.json`** | Deduped list of `NCollection_*<T...>` instantiations the discover pass enumerated from the consumer's bound classes. Consumed by the link-time filter to retain only the symbols actually needed. |
| **`build/occt-cmake/`** | OCCT object files produced by `emcmake cmake` build of OCCT itself. These get linked into the final wasm by `wasm-ld`. Cached per compile-config. |

### H. Support tooling

| name | role |
| --- | --- |
| **CMake** | Configures and drives OCCT's own C++ build (compiles OCCT's `.cxx` into object archives) before `emcc` links them into wasm. Run via `emcmake cmake` to inject `emcc` as the compiler. Pinned in `requirements.txt`. |
| **Doxygen** | Parses OCCT's `/** … */` comments into XML; `extract-docs.py` folds that into the generated `.d.ts` JSDoc. Does not touch the wasm itself. Uses the system-installed `doxygen`. |
| **Nx** | Workspace build orchestrator. Caches per-task outputs so re-running unchanged steps is a no-op. The host build pipeline goes through Nx targets. See [Caching Behavior](#caching-behavior). |
| **Docker** | Alternative isolation: the same scripts run inside a Linux container with emsdk pre-installed. See [Consumer Workflows → Docker](#docker). |
| **Node.js** | Runs the JS-side smoke tests and `npm pack` for distribution. Pinned via `.nvmrc`. Not in the parse or compile pipelines. |

### Build outputs (what the pipeline produces)

The output set per consumer YAML. Names come from the YAML's `mainBuild.name` (here illustrated as `my_build`).

| artifact | role |
| --- | --- |
| **`my_build.wasm`** | The compiled WebAssembly module — OCCT geometry kernel, embind glue, all linked together. The thing browsers and Node load. |
| **`my_build.js`** | JS wrapper emitted by `emcc` — module loader, exported function thunks, embind runtime. Imports the `.wasm` and exposes the JS API. |
| **`my_build.d.ts`** | TypeScript declarations emitted by the bindgen's codegen. Type fidelity here depends on the discover pass having enumerated every reachable NCollection instantiation; gaps surface as `: number` or `: unknown` downgrades. |
| **`my_build.js.symbols`** | Symbol table emitted by `wasm-ld`. Useful for diffing two builds to see which symbols were retained or dropped. |

### How the components flow together

A single end-to-end build, with each step labelled by which component does the work:

1. **A** (`clone-deps.sh`) materialises **emsdk**, **OCCT**, **rapidjson**, **FreeType** under `deps/`.
2. **A** (`uv`) creates `.venv/` and installs **F**'s Python dependencies (including the **B** `libclang` binding).
3. **F** (`paths.py`, `buildFlatIncludes()`) builds **G** (the flat include directory).
4. **F** (`paths.py`, `buildPch()`) calls **D** (`emcc`) to build **G** (the PCH).
5. **F** (`ast/parse.py`) calls **B** (`libclang`) to parse **E** (OCCT headers via the flat include dir) using **C** (`libc++` headers).
6. **F** (`discover.py`) walks the resulting AST and writes **G** (`ncollection-manifest.json`).
7. **F** (`codegen/embind/`) generates embind C++ source.
8. **D** (`emcc`) compiles the generated source + OCCT source into `.o` files, using the **G** PCH for speed.
9. **D** (`wasm-ld`) links the `.o` set into a `.wasm`, with **F** (`link/rewrite.py`) applying the NCollection filter.
10. **D** (`wasm-opt`) shrinks the linked wasm.
11. The build outputs (`my_build.wasm`, `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.symbols`) land in the consumer's chosen output directory.

The [Task Graph](#task-graph) below is the Nx-orchestrated version of steps 4–10 with the parallelism and caching annotations.

## Task Graph

```
setup (uncached) → pch → generate → compile-bindings ─┐
                     │                                   ├─→ link → build
                     └─→ compile-sources ───────────────┘
```

`compile-bindings` and `compile-sources` run in parallel after `pch` completes.

## configurations.json

All named compile-time configurations live in `build-configs/configurations.json`. Each entry is a map of `OCJS_*` environment variable names to values.

### Supported keys

The **bare default** is what `build-wasm.sh` falls back to with no `--config` and no env var set. The **`default` config** column reflects what `configurations.json`'s `default` entry sets — and what every named config (`O3-wasm-exc-simd`, `O3-noLTO-simd`, `Os-noLTO-simd`) sets for these same flags.

| Key                   | Description                                             | Bare default      | `default` config |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `OCJS_OPT`            | Compile optimization level (`-O0`, `-O2`, `-O3`, `-Os`) | `-O2`             | `-O3`            |
| `OCJS_LTO`            | Enable LTO at compile time (`0` or `1`)                 | `0`               | `0`              |
| `OCJS_EXCEPTIONS`     | Enable native WASM exceptions (`0` or `1`)              | `0`               | `0` (`1` in `O3-wasm-exc-simd`) |
| `OCJS_SIMD`           | Enable baseline SIMD (`-msimd128`, `0` or `1`)          | `0`               | `1`              |
| `OCJS_RELAXED_SIMD`   | Enable Relaxed SIMD opcodes (requires `OCJS_SIMD=1`; Safari 26.x does not yet implement Relaxed SIMD) | `0`               | `0` |
| `OCJS_BIGINT`         | Enable `-sWASM_BIGINT` for native i64↔BigInt           | `0`               | `1`              |
| `THREADING`           | Threading mode (`single-threaded` or `multi-threaded`)  | `single-threaded` | `single-threaded` |
| `OCJS_DEFINES`        | Comma-separated C preprocessor defines                  | _(empty)_         | `OCCT_NO_DUMP`   |
| `OCJS_UNDEFINES`      | Comma-separated C preprocessor undefines                | _(empty)_         | `OCC_CONVERT_SIGNALS` |
| `OCJS_WASM_OPT_LEVEL` | wasm-opt optimization level                             | `-O3`             | `-O4`            |
| `OCJS_CLOSURE`        | Run Closure Compiler (`true` or `false`)                | `false`           | `true`           |
| `OCJS_EVAL_CTORS`     | Enable Emscripten eval ctors (`true` or `false`)        | `false`           | `true`           |
| `OCJS_EVAL_CTORS_LEVEL` | `-sEVAL_CTORS=N` level when `OCJS_EVAL_CTORS=true`    | `2`               | `2`              |
| `OCJS_CONVERGE`       | Use `--converge` in wasm-opt (`true` or `false`)        | `false`           | `true`           |
| `OCJS_PATCH_DUMP`     | Patch OCCT Standard_Dump.hxx (`true` or `false`)        | `false`           | `true`           |
| `OCJS_EXTRA_CFLAGS`   | Extra compile flags appended to C/CXX                   | _(empty)_         | _(empty)_        |

### Adding a new configuration

Add an entry to `build-configs/configurations.json`:

```json
{
  "my-experiment": {
    "OCJS_OPT": "-O3",
    "OCJS_LTO": "1",
    "OCJS_EXCEPTIONS": "0",
    "OCJS_SIMD": "1",
    "OCJS_BIGINT": "1",
    "THREADING": "single-threaded",
    "OCJS_WASM_OPT_LEVEL": "-O4",
    "OCJS_CLOSURE": "true",
    "OCJS_EVAL_CTORS": "true",
    "OCJS_CONVERGE": "true"
  }
}
```

Unspecified keys fall back to the bare defaults in `build-wasm.sh` (see the table above).

## Consumer YAML Format

The consumer YAML format is unchanged from v7.6.2:

```yaml
mainBuild:
  name: my_build.js
  bindings:
    - symbol: TopoDS_Shape
    - symbol: BRepBuilderAPI_MakeEdge
  emccFlags:
    - -O3
    - -flto
    - -fwasm-exceptions
    - -sEXPORT_ES6=1
    - -sMODULARIZE
    - -sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1
    - -sWASM_BIGINT
    - --no-entry
```

All `emccFlags` are passed **verbatim** to `emcc` at link time. The consumer has full control over link-time behavior.

## Fill-Not-Strip Rules

When linking, the build system applies "fill-not-strip" logic for optimization and LTO flags:

1. If consumer `emccFlags` already contains an `-O*` flag → used as-is
2. If consumer `emccFlags` lacks `-O*` → the config's `OCJS_OPT` value is added (default: `-O2`)
3. If consumer `emccFlags` already contains `-flto` → used as-is
4. If consumer `emccFlags` lacks `-flto` and `OCJS_LTO=1` → `-flto` is added

Consumer flags are never stripped or modified.

## Flag Precedence

For compile-time flags, precedence is (highest to lowest):

1. Explicit env var in the shell (e.g., `OCJS_OPT=-Os`)
2. Value from `configurations.json` entry (via `--config`)
3. `build-wasm.sh` built-in defaults

## Consistency Validation

The build system warns (non-fatal) when compile-time and link-time flags are mismatched:

- Compiled with `OCJS_EXCEPTIONS=1` but emccFlags has `-sDISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=1`
- Compiled with `OCJS_SIMD=1` but emccFlags lacks `-msimd128`
- Compiled without exceptions but emccFlags has `-fwasm-exceptions`

## Caching Behavior

Nx computes cache keys from `namedInputs` defined in `nx.json`:

- **compileConfig**: `configurations.json` content, `OCJS_CONFIG`, and all compile-time `OCJS_*` env vars
- **linkConfig**: Post-processing env vars (`OCJS_WASM_OPT_LEVEL`, `OCJS_CLOSURE`, `OCJS_CONVERGE`, etc.)
- **toolchain**: `emcc --version` output
- **depsVersion**: `DEPS.json` content
- **generatorCode**: All `src/**/*.py` files and `bindgen-filters.yaml`

### Cache sharing

Same config + different consumer YAMLs → compile targets cache-hit, link target cache-miss.
Different configs → fully separate compile caches.

### Debugging cache misses

```bash
npx nx show project ocjs         # Show resolved project config
NX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true npx nx run ocjs:pch  # Verbose logging
```

## Maintainer Workflows

### Full build with a named configuration

```bash
./build-wasm.sh --config default full path/to/consumer.yml
```

### Link only (reuses compile cache)

```bash
./build-wasm.sh --config default link path/to/consumer.yml
```

### Override a single flag from the config

```bash
OCJS_WASM_OPT_LEVEL=-O4 ./build-wasm.sh --config default full consumer.yml
```

### Using Nx directly

```bash
OCJS_CONFIG=default OCJS_YAML=path/to/consumer.yml npx nx run ocjs:build
```

### Running individual targets

```bash
OCJS_CONFIG=default npx nx run ocjs:pch
OCJS_CONFIG=default npx nx run ocjs:generate
OCJS_CONFIG=default npx nx run ocjs:compile-bindings
OCJS_CONFIG=default npx nx run ocjs:compile-sources
OCJS_CONFIG=default OCJS_YAML=consumer.yml npx nx run ocjs:link
```

## Consumer Workflows

### Docker

```bash
docker run -e OCJS_CONFIG=default \
  -v $(pwd)/my-config.yml:/src/config.yml \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
  opencascade-js link /src/config.yml
```

### Checkout-based

```bash
cd repos/opencascade.js
./scripts/clone-deps.sh
./build-wasm.sh --config default full path/to/consumer.yml
```

## Self-Contained Dependencies

Run `scripts/clone-deps.sh` to clone all dependencies into `deps/` (pass
`--dest <dir>` to target a different location, e.g. `--dest ..` for the
legacy sibling layout):

- `deps/emsdk/` — Emscripten SDK (version from `DEPS.json`)
- `deps/OCCT/` — OpenCASCADE Technology (pinned commit)
- `deps/rapidjson/` — RapidJSON (pinned commit)
- `deps/freetype/` — FreeType (pinned commit)

The script is idempotent and validates pinned commits when `OCJS_STRICT_DEPS=1`.

## Migration from v2

v2 drove the source build through the Python entry point `src/buildFromYaml.py` (wrapped by the Docker image's `ENTRYPOINT`). v3 replaces that with a single shell wrapper, `build-wasm.sh`, sitting on top of Nx-managed bindgen / compile / link steps. Behaviours that consumers of a v2 custom build may need to adjust:

| v2                                   | v3                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/buildFromYaml.py <yaml>`        | `./build-wasm.sh [--config <name>] <subcommand> <yaml>`   |
| `../assimpjs/emsdk` (relative path)  | `deps/emsdk/` (cloned via `clone-deps.sh`)                |
| Flag stripping in `buildFromYaml.py` | Fill-not-strip (consumer flags pass through verbatim)     |
| `OCJS_BIGINT` env var appendage      | Consumer specifies `-sWASM_BIGINT` directly in emccFlags  |
| `OCJS_EVAL_CTORS` env var appendage  | Consumer specifies `-sEVAL_CTORS=N` directly in emccFlags |

Cache and task-graph mechanics (Nx content-hashing, `npx nx reset` for cleanup, the `dependsOn` task graph) are v3-only and have no v2 equivalent — they replace the implicit single-shot Python pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

### Stale dependencies

```bash
rm -rf deps/ && ./scripts/clone-deps.sh
```

### Unexpected cache miss

Set `NX_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true` to see which inputs changed.

### Flag consistency warnings

These are non-fatal. They indicate a mismatch between compile-time configuration and consumer link-time flags. Review both your `--config` choice and consumer YAML's `emccFlags`.

### Full cache reset

```bash
npx nx reset
```
